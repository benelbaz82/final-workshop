## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Architecture Document describes the comprehensive architecture for the Status-Page application - a Django-based web application designed to provide system status monitoring and incident management capabilities. The document covers the cloud-native AWS EKS deployment architecture for production environments.

### 1.2 Scope
This document encompasses:
- Application architecture and component design
- AWS EKS cloud-native deployment architecture
- Infrastructure, security, and operational considerations
- CI/CD pipeline architecture
- Quality attributes and non-functional requirements

---

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Business Context
The Status-Page application serves as a centralized platform for:
- **System Status Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into system health
- **Incident Management**: Tracking and communication of system incidents
- **Service Availability**: Public-facing status dashboard for end users
- **Notification Management**: Automated alerts and status updates

### 2.2 System Capabilities
- **Web Dashboard**: Administrative interface for status management
- **Public Status Page**: Customer-facing system status display
- **Background Processing**: Asynchronous task processing for notifications and monitoring
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Automated system health checks and maintenance
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs for external system integration

---

## 3. Application Architecture

### 3.1 Core Components
- **Web Layer**: Django application with Gunicorn WSGI server
- **Background Processing**: RQ workers for async tasks (notifications, monitoring)
- **Scheduler**: Periodic task management for health checks and maintenance
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL database with Redis cache and message queue

### 3.2 Key Features
- Multi-tenant status page management
- Real-time status monitoring and incident tracking
- RESTful API for external integrations
- Automated notifications and reporting

**Architecture Diagram:** See `arch/status_page_architecture.png`
